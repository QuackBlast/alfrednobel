# Alien SDL Game

This is a simple game created with SDL2. This project demonstrates the structure of a simple game which uses multiple SLD2 libraries and also includes external resources such as images and fonts. The project is a demonstration of organization of folders, source-code, libraries and reflecting the same in a Makefile.

This project assumes you have understood the mechanism of compiling SDL2 based C programs as discussed in the tutorial [here](https://github.com/Makerspace-KTH/sdl_hello).

This project acts as a reference framework to organise C projects such as games.

## Compiling and running

As per the operating system, rename the Makefile to build the _alien_ game.

Expected output:
